# Small Animals' Worth

SmallAnimalsWorth is a game where tiny animals battle against larger ones, created using Unity. The game features three levels, each with a different theme and animals. As you progress, the levels get progressively harder. 🐦

In the game, you can choose to heal or attack. Your opponents have three types of attacks: a regular one that reduces your health bar, a bullet hell attack where you dodge flying objects like bananas or sushi, and a summoning attack that calls for help, launching another bullet hell where you dodge attacking animals. To win, you need to reduce the enemy's health bar to zero. 🦎

This game was developed as the Final Project for the 3D Game Development course at University of Debrecen, led by [Dr. Kruppa Kinga Tünde](https://inf.unideb.hu/en/dr-kinga-tunde-kruppa), from February 2023 to June 2023. Other projects completed during the course can be viewed in the repository [here](https://github.com/FedeDC512/unity-projects). 🐠
